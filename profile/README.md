# Messy Virgo

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Messy Virgo crypto project and the **$MESSY** AI agent token on Base.

---

## Overview

Messy Virgo is an AI-native initiative building an on-chain **agent stack** that turns complex fund-style tooling into an approachable experience for everyday crypto users and active traders.

Instead of a black-box "AI trading bot," Messy focuses on transparent, lens-based intelligence across three core analytical dimensions (technical, macro-economic, and social/narrative) that anyone can inspect, question, and use to inform their own decisions.

- **Token**: $MESSY (Base CA: `0x09f87f948c88848363b124c9099cbb58e4cc7cb6`)
- **Core Focus**: Multi-dimensional agentic due diligence (technical, macro, social/narrative), lens-based market analysis, and eventually autonomous-but-constrained fund orchestration
- **Community**: Narrative-driven, security-conscious, and oriented around open progress logs rather than hype-only campaigns

---

## Current Product Surface

The GitHub org tracks the implementation of Messy's growing agent toolchain and on-chain infrastructure.

- **Agentic Due Diligence Engine (Phase 2)** – A modular "lens" stack that ingests social, news, on-chain, and market data to surface structured insights, not raw noise
- **[Technical Analysis Lens](https://app.messyvirgo.com/technical-analyses) (live dApp)** – Produces structured snapshots of trend, momentum, volatility, market health, and key price levels for any supported token
- **[Macro Economic Lens](https://app.messyvirgo.com/macro-economics) (live dApp)** – Provides higher-level market regime and risk context to complement short-term technical signals
- **[Social & Narrative Lens](https://app.messyvirgo.com/social-narrative) (live dApp)** – Monitors community sentiment, social media engagement, narrative momentum, and influencer activity to provide context on token buzz and narrative-driven market moves
- **Treasury & Fund Infrastructure** – Audited, renounced Base token contracts, treasury routing, and tracking to support future fund execution layers once the agent is ready

## Roadmap & Phases

Messy Virgo follows a multi-phase roadmap that moves from culture and narrative curation into full agentic portfolio orchestration:

- **Phase 1 – Culture Engine**: Community, narratives, and transparency-first treasury tracking to anchor trust before automation
- **Phase 2 – Minimum Viable Intelligence (in progress)**: Lens-based Agentic Due Diligence Engine, including the [Technical Analysis Lens](https://app.messyvirgo.com/technical-analyses), [Macro Economic Lens](https://app.messyvirgo.com/macro-economics), and [Social & Narrative Lens](https://app.messyvirgo.com/social-narrative)
- **Phase 3 – Autonomous Trader (planned)**: Math-driven portfolio optimization and live strategy execution for on-chain funds, operating under explicit risk and governance constraints
- **Phase 4 – DAO Transition (planned)**: Progressive handover of treasury and strategy parameters to the community via on-chain governance

## Documentation

Documentation is being aligned with the public website and dApps rather than a static PDF-only experience:

- **Interactive Litepaper** – Hosted on messyvirgo.com with tokenomics, security model, and the full AI roadmap
- **Product Docs** – Per-module documentation (e.g., Technical Analysis Lens behavior, data model, limitations) will be published alongside each dApp and service as repos mature
- **Build Log** – Weekly updates on marketing, product, and infra decisions, including audits, data provider changes, and new lenses

---

## Getting Involved

This organization is the home for Messy's open-source components, smart contracts, and technical specs.

- Watch for public issues, bounties, and tagged "good first issues" as individual repos open up
- Explore the live experience via the website and dApps, then use GitHub to track how the stack is actually built over time
